# CremFuelled's PDF Merger

Quick python project which merges PDFs using the PyPDF2 module.

## How to use

The "Merge" functions serves to merge pages from different PDFs. You can enter, in order, the paths and pages you want from each pdf and specify a name and author for the PDF. (A GUI version of this is currently in the works)

Note that since I have not started work on the "edit" function yet, the "merge" function must be used to change the ordering of pages within a single pdf.

The "metadata" function is still in the works, but will help you change the metadata of any pdf file.

## Future Functionality

Aside from what's covered above, there are no current plans on expanding this project since it is mostly for personal and friends' use.
