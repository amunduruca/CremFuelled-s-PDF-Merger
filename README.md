# CremFuelled-s-PDF-Merger

Quick python project which merges PDFs using the PyPDF2 module.

## How to use

You can merge pdf files using the "merge" function, for which it will prompt you at first. From there you can enter, in order, the paths and pages you want from each pdf and specify a name and author for the PDF.

Note that the "merge" function can be used to change the ordering of pages within a single pdf as well, although I may consider adding this as its own function later.

The "metadata" function is still in the works, but will help you change the metadata of any pdf file.

## Future Functionality

Aside from what's covered above, there are no current plans on expanding this project since it is mostly for personal and friends' use.
